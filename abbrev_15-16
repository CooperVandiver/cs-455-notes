-user satisfaction =
    -compliant product
    -good quality
    -delivery within budget and schedule
-software quality
    -effective software process applied in a manner that creates a useful
     product that provides measurable value for those who produce it and those
     who use it
-three points
    -effective software process
    -useful product
    -adding value for both the producer and user

-Quality in Use Model
    -appropriate when considering using the product in a particular context
-Quality in Use Model Characteristics
    -Effectiveness
    -Efficiency
    -Satisfaction

-Product in Quality Model
    -focus on both static and dynamic nature of computer systems
-Product in Quality Model Characteristics
    -Reliability
    -Security
    -Maintainability
-Cost of Quality
    -Costs of adding quality combined with not providing enough quality
-Prevention Costs
    -cost of management activities for quality control and QA activities
    -cost of added technical activities to develop complete requirements and
     design models
    -test planning costs
    -cost of training
-Appraisal Costs
    -activities to gain insight into product condition the first time through
     each process
-Appraisal Costs Examples
    -conducting technical reviews
    -data collection and metrics evaluation
    -cost of testing and debugging
-Internal Failure
    -error in product before shipment
-Internal Failure Costs
    -reworking to correct error
    -when rework generates side effects that must be mitigated
    -collection of quality metrics to assess modes of failure
-External Failure
    -defects after shipment
-External Failure Costs
    -complaint resolution
    -warranty work
    -poor reputation/loss of business
-Impact of Management Decisions on Product Quality
    -Estimation Decisions
    -Scheduling Decisions
    -Risk-Oriented Decisions
-Defect Prediction
    -Statistical techniques to examine relationships between software metrics
     and components containing known software defects
-Error vs Defect
    -Error is before shipment
    -Defect is after shipment
-Design activites introduce between 50-65% of errors
-Review techniques are up to 75% effective at finding design flaws
-Defect Amplification
    -one defect may cause more errors later on
-Defect Propagation
    -impact of an undiscovered error on futrue dev activities or product
     behavior
-Technical Review Metrics
    -Review Effort
        -Sum of effort measures for reviews
        - = E_{review} = E_p + E_a + E_r
    -Total Erros Found
        -Sum of errors found
        - = Err_{tot} = Err_{minor} + Err_{major}
    -Error Density
        -Errors found per unit of work product reviews
        - = ErrorDensity = Err_{tot} / WPS
-Putting more effort into early and frequent technical reviews leads to reduced
 peak effort and decreased deployment time 
-Factors leading to increased technical review formality
    -Distinct roles explicitly defined for reviewers
    -Sufficient amount of planning and preparation for review
    -Distinct structure for review is defined
    -Follow-up by reviewers occurs for any corrections that are made
-Developing a review checklist for major work products increased the efficacy of
 informal reviews
-Formal Technical Review (FTR) Objectives
    -Uncover errors in function, logic, or implementation
    -Verify software meets requirements
    -make projects more manageable
-FTR Constraints
    -Between 3-5 people should be involved
    -Prep should require <= 2 hours of work per person
    -Duration of meeting should be <= 2 hours
-FTR Decision Options
    -Accept product without modification
    -Reject product due to severe errors (another FTR required)
    -Accept product provisionally
-Producer
    -Developed work product
-Review Leader
    -Evaluates product for readiness
    -Generates copies of product materials
    -distributes them to 2-3 reviewers for prep
-Reviewer
    -Spends 1-2 hours reviewing, making notes, and familiarizing with product
-Recorder
    -Individual who records all important issues raised during review
-Review Issue list Purposes
    -identify problem areas within product
    -serve as action item checklist to guide corrections being made
-FTR Guidelines
    -Review product, not the producer
    -Set agenda and maintain it
    -Limit debate and rebuttal
